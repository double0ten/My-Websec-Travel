## Welcome to My Reddit for Websec 670

This is the personal website for Lin Shi during CPEG670 Websec. The whole semester I got the lot from this class including javascript, website hardening and attacking, sql injection and prevent it, MEAN stack and simple attack and defense skills. More importantly, there are two projects about web skills. Here I will list all of that and divided them accroding to mastery level. 

### Skilled
- HTML Forms
- PHP scripting
- SQLite Databases
- Apache
- Sessions & Cookies
- Mongo DB
- Oauth
- MySQL
- Websockets
- SSL certs
- Hashing, Salting, Stretching
- SQL injection

### Known
- Javascript
- NodeJS
- Express & Angular
- Role-Based Access Control
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

### Needed to improve
- AWS EC2s
- XSS & CSRF attack skills
- Serverless-Stacks
- Session Hijacking

In one word, I think the most urgent thing I needed to improve is the my basic website attacking and defensing skills like XSS & CSRF. This is not only the key knowledge for the class, but also the key stone for my future, because I really want to be a good researcher in the network security field. I do a lot of pratice about CTF, and web part is also my weakest part.
